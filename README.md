2. Select a secret number within the allowed range.
3. Share the generated challenge link with your opponent.

### Opponent
1. Open the challenge link provided by the challenger.
2. Enter your guesses into the input field.

4. Continue guessing until you find the correct number. The first to guess correctly wins the gauntlet!
